{"name":"Libmcrypt","tagline":"","body":"Libmcrypt is a thread-safe library providing a uniform interface\r\nto access several block and stream encryption algorithms.\r\nCheck the manual page for more information on libmcrypt.\r\n\r\nLook at COPYING for license information and the individual files for more \r\ninformation. COPYING applies only for the mcrypt program and not the \r\nalgorithms which most of them are public domain.\r\n\r\nA mailing list on mcrypt is mcrypt-dev@lists.hellug.gr\r\nSubscribe by visiting http://lists.hellug.gr/mailman/listinfo/mcrypt-dev\r\n\r\n**\r\n** Some hints:\r\n\r\nSince 2.5.4 libmcrypt does not use dynamic loading for the modules by default.\r\nAll the algorithms and modes, are now included in the library. To enable\r\nthe old dynamic loading behaviour use the --enable-dynamic-loading in the\r\nconfigure script.\r\n\r\nThat way you can statically link the library and be 100% thread safe,\r\nsince dlopen is not always thread safe.\r\n\r\nYou can also enable dynamic loading and include some algorithms into the\r\nlibrary. To include algorithms in the library use the\r\n--with-included-algos parameter in the configure script.\r\nEg: ./configure --with-included-algos=\"rijndael-128 arcfour stream cbc cfb\"\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
